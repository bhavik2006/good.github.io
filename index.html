            <h2>My love, 🌸</h2>
            <p>I know sometimes, in anger or frustration, I’ve said things about leaving or walking away.</p>
            <p>💔 For that, I am truly sorry. You are my heart, my happiness, and my everything. 🥹</p>
            <p>The truth is, I can never imagine my life without you.</p>
            <p>❤️ I’m not perfect, and I make mistakes, but my love for you is the purest thing I’ve ever known. 💕</p>
            <p>You’ve taught me what it means to love and to be loved.</p>
            <p>🌹 When you are with me, I feel complete, as if the world is brighter and my purpose is clear. 🌟</p>
            <p>I want you to know that even in moments of anger, my heart still beats for you.</p>
            <p>💓 And every time I’ve hurt you with my words, I’ve regretted it deeply. </p>
            <p>🙏 You are my home, my safe place, and my biggest blessing. 🏡✨</p>
            <h3>I promise to be better for you, to choose love over anger, and to never let go of the bond we share. 💖</h3>
            <p>Thank you for understanding me when I fail to understand myself. 🫶</p>
            <h3>You are not just my partner—you are my life, my strength, and my forever. ❤️</h3>
